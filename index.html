    Welcome to Rajib's component library.
    I am learning HTML now.

    Now starting the learning wih different types of headings.
    There are 6 sizes of heading as shown below=h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6.
    h1 beig the largest and h6 being smallest

    <h1>h1=This is the biggest heading</h1>
    <h2>h2=This is the 2nd biggest heading</h2>
    <h3>h3=This is th 3rd biggest heading</h3>
    <h4>h4=This is the 4th biggest heading</h4>
    <h5>h5=This is the 5th bigest heading</h5>
    <h6>h6=This is the 6th biggest heading</h6>

    Now, let me show you the writing content. It sis wrriten inside "<""p" 

    <p>Material is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and 
        tools that support the best practices of user interface design. 
        Backed by open-source code, Material streamlines collaboration 
        between designers and developers, and helps teams quickly build 
        beautiful products.
    </p>

    <p>Break line is made by writing "<""hr". Below is the sample</p>
    <hr>
    <p>For small size text you can use "<""small"</p>
    <small>Material is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and 
        tools that support the best practices of user interface design. 
        Backed by open-source code, Material streamlines collaboration
