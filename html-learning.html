    <h1>Breaking more than 1 sentence into new lines using "br" & "pre"</h1>
    <p>You can use "br" to break the sentences into a new line.Below is the example</p>
    <p>
        I am Rajib Das.<br>I live in Toronto.<br>I came to Canada in 2020
    </p>
    <p> The HTML &lt pre &gt element defines preformatted text.
    The text inside a &lt pre &gt element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and 
    line breaks:</p>
    <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

                   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <p>
        HTML includes various tags for different types of lists. Here's an explanation.
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Unordered List</strong> </dt>
            <dd>The "ul" element represents an unordered list. An unordered list is a list where the list items are listed in no 
            particular order. Therefore, each list item can be listed without numbers or other ordering mechanisms. An unordered 
            list will typically be displayed with round or square bullet points next to each item (as opposed to numbers or letters etc). 
            <ul>
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By default the markings are in bullets, you can change them by using style = "list-style: circle/square/none</p>

            <ul style="list-style: square;">
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            

            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Ordered List</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                "ol" element represents an ordered list. An ordered list is a list where the items have been ordered intentionally. 
                The main point of an ordered list is that the list items need to be ordered in order to convey the intended meaning.

                Also, for ordered list if you don't want the numbers you can change them by using "type" tag.
                <ol>
                  <li>Apple</li>
                  <li>Banana</li>
                  <li>Grapes</li>
                </ol>  
              <p>Now by using "type:" attribute</p>
              <ol type="i">
                  <li>Apple</li>
                  <li>Banana</li>
                  <li>Grapes</li>
  
              </ol>   
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Definition List</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                "dl" represents a definition list. In a definition list, each list item contains two or more entries; a term and at least one 
                description. The term is represented by the "dt" element and the description is represented by the "dd" element. 
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <h1>HTML attributes</h1>
    <p>
        Attributes are extra pieces of code that can be inserted inside an HTML tag. They allow you to define how an HTML element 
        should be presented or how it should behave.
    </p>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In the above example, the "ol" tag has had an attribute added to it. The attribute is called "start" and its value is 5. 
        This attribute allows us to specify what number to start the list at.Similarly, we can have attribute for a reverse ordered list
    </p>
    <ol reversed start="2">
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For reverse ordered list I used "ol reversed start=2"
    </p>

    <h1><b>Inline and Block elements</b></h1>
    <dl>
        
        <dt>Block elements</dt>
        <dd>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content 
            that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are 
            usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, 
            navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested 
            inside another block-level element.
            <br>
            Block elements are those that take the entire width of webpage, eg paragraph and div
            <p style="background-color: aqua;">This is Rajib</p>
            <p style="background-color: greenyellow;">I am learning coding</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Inline element</dt>
        <dd>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the document's content 
            (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. 
            It is typically used with text, for example an &lt a &gt element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as 
            &lt em &gt or &lt strong &gt create emphasis.
            <br>
            The inline elements are those that take the space till the text length, for example anchor links and span 
            <br>
            <a style="background-color: red;" href="/">Google   </a>
            <a style="background-color: blue;" href="/">facebook</a>
        </dd>
        <dt>Void Element</dt>
        <dd>
            Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, 
            which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements. For example, 
            the &lt img &gt element embeds an image file onto a page:
        </dd>
       
    </dl>
    <h1>HTML Links</h1>
    <p>
        The above link is an example of a hyperlink. A hyperlink is a link that allows the user to navigate to another resource 
        (such as a web page) or download it (such as in downloading a file). In this case, we link to Google.
        <br>
        A hyperlink is created by using the "a href" tag, which is used to specify the destination URL.
        <br>
        The "a href" tag has a start and end tag. Any text or element between the start and end tag becomes the "clickable" part. 
        You'll notice that most web browsers will display hyperlinked text in a different color and underlined. However, as with 
        any HTML element, you do have control over how the link is styled by using CSS.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
    <p>Now if you observe, once you clicked on Google link it opened up in same browser, other way to say that client is moving way 
        from your browser. Now in order to link to open a new browser, set the tag "target=_blank". Click on the google link below
    </p>

    <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google - opening on a new tab</a>

    <p>The "title" attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to known
        as tooltip.For example, title="The Google homepage". This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.
        See the below example</p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Google Homepage-click to proceed">Google</a>
    <p>Also, if you want to make a link to click to send email you can use the "a href = mailto:" </p>

    <a href="mailto: drajib0510@gmail.com">Send an email</a>
    <p><strong>BUtton as link: </strong>You can use &lt button onclick &gt for creating a button to link to a new site</p>

    <!-- <button onclick="https://www.google.com/">Click for google</button> -->
    <p><strong>Create a BookMark with &lt a href &gt</strong></p>
    <p>You can create a book mark by using &lt a href = "#(to the particular bookmarked location & marking the bookmarked position 
        with "id") &gt. Below is the example where I will go to HTML tables
    </p>
    <br>
    <a href="#Table" target="_blank" title="Table">Click to go to HTML table</a>

    <h1>Image & alt attribute with image</h1>
    <p>
        In HTML, you add images to a web page by using the "img src" tag, which is used to specify the image location.The 
        "img src" tag does not have an end tag. Only the start tag is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image must be at the specified location, otherwise you will end up with a "broken image". This means that, if the image 
        doesn't already exist on the web, you'll need to upload it before it will work on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image must have the alt attribute specified. This attribute is used to provide a description of the image. 
        This is important, as it is possible that not all users will be able to see the image.
        <br>
        Here are some examples of where the alt attribute can be beneficial:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>User has disabled images on their browser.</li>
        <li>User has a slow internet connection, and images sometimes don't load.</li>
        <li>User is using text to speech software or a voice web browser. This could be because the user has a vision impairment, 
            or it could simply be that the user has chosen to use this feature to give his/her eyes a rest. It could also be that 
            the user finds it easier to listen to long blocks of text than to read. In these cases, the software would read out any 
            alt text and the image will still make sense to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            User is using a text-only browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            There's a problem with the image (or the HTML) resulting in a "broken image".
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src = "photos-and-videos/flower.svg" alt="image of a flower">
    <p>Also you can set the image width & height by using "width" & "height" attributes</p>
    <img src="http://thescienceexplorer.com/sites/thescienceexplorer.com/files/blog/tyrannosaurus-855188_1280.jpg"
    alt="image of dino">
    <p>In addition to setting both width & height , you can choose to set any one. By doing this HTML will automatically adjust the 
        aspect ratio.
    </p>  

    <img height="300px" src ="http://thescienceexplorer.com/sites/thescienceexplorer.com/files/blog/tyrannosaurus-855188_1280.jpg"
    alt="image of a dino">

    <p><strong>Image Floating</strong></p>
    <p>Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:</p>
    <p>The image will float to the right of the text.
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/NSrAFkmmOdMAAAAi/smile-smiley.gif" height="50px" alt="Smile image" style="float:right;">
    </p>
    <p>The image will float at left
        <img src="	https://media.tenor.com/NSrAFkmmOdMAAAAi/smile-smiley.gif" alt="smile" height="20px" style="float: left;">
    </p>

    <h1>Videos</h1>
    <h2>Videos in computer</h2>
    <p1>you can either use a video in computer or link from internet/website by using tag "video src". Also , to make the video playable
        you need to add "controls" tag
    </p1>
    <video controls width="500px" src="/photos-and-videos/video.mp4" > Sample video</video>
    <br>
    <p1>Also, if yo want to add a poster or thumbnail for the video , you can do so by using tag"poster"</p1>
    <br>
    <video height="300px" controls poster="/photos-and-videos/hero.svg" src="/photos-and-videos/video.mp4">Sample video</video>
    <br>
    <h2>Videos on line (You Tube)</h2>
    <p1>Go to You tube , click on the video you want to link, click on share and get embedded link and simply paste in HTML</p1>
    <br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GfNEDs3ERw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
    allowfullscreen></iframe>



    <h1 id="Table">HTML Tables</h1>
    <p1>
        In HTML, you can create a table by using the "table" tag along with the "tr" and "td" tags:
        <br>
        Each "tr" element represents a table row. Each "td" element represents a data cell.
        <br>
        The "th" is used for table heading
        <br>
        The "table" element supports the "border" and the "sortable" attributes.Using the border attribute will typically result in 
        the browser rendering a basic border around the table and its cells.
        <br>
        Two other attributes you might find useful when working with tables are the "colspan" and "rowspan" attributes. These can be used 
        with the "th" and "td" elements. They allow you to specify how many columns or rows the cell can merge/span.
        "caption" is used to give the table name.
    </p1>
    <table border="2">
        <caption>
            Country-Capital-Official Language
        </caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Country Name</th>
            <th>Capital</th>
            <th>Official Language</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>India</td>
            <td>New Delhi</td>
            <td>Hindi</td>

    <h1> HTML Text Codes</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Bold text</strong></dt>
        <dd>You can make a statement bold by using <strong>"strong"</strong> tag</dd>
        <dd>You can also make a statement bold by using <b>"b"</b> tag</dd>
        <dd>Also there is an option of using attribute "style=font-weight" to make the text look diffrently.Below is the example</dd>
       <dd> <p style="font-weight: bold;"> My name is Raib</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;">My name is Rajib</p>
        <p style="font-weight: lighter;">My name is Rajib</p>
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><b>Text Alignment</b></dt>
        <dd>You can use attribute "style=text-align" to align the text left,right or centre etc. Showing the example below</dd>
        <dd>
        <p style="text-align: center;">My name is Rajib</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">My name is Rajib</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;">My name is Rajib</p>
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt><b>Decorating Text</b></dt>
        <dd>You can use the attribute "style=text-decoration" for underlining, or removing underline, line across text etc.
            Below is the example to show you better
        <p style="text-decoration: underline;">My name is Rajib</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">My name is Rajib</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: overline;">My name is Rajib</p>

        <p>Now to put a line-through a particular word or to color th background/highlight of a word in a sentence, you cannot use the 
            CSS style saying line-through or background-color . You need to use "del" to make line-through and "mark" to highlight.
            Below is the example
        </p>
        <p>I am now changing the color <del>red by striking out</del> and adding new color green by highlighting the process of 
        <mark>photosynthesis</mark>  </p>

    <h1> HTML Entities</h1>    
    <p>In HTML, the characters <, >,",' and & are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax itself. So how do you include 
        one of these special characters in your text? For example, if you want to use an ampersand or less-than sign, and not have it 
        interpreted as code.
        You do this with character references. These are special codes that represent characters, to be used in these exact 
        circumstances. Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&), and ends with a semicolon (;).
    </p>
    <p>Below is the link for Entities</p>

<h1>Importance of adding class</h1>
<p>The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and 
    manipulate elements with the specific class name.
<br>
    In the following example we have three &lt div &gt elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three 
    &lt div &gt elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:</p>

    <div class="london">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is capital of England</p>
    </div>
    <div class="delhi main">
        <h2>New Delhi</h2>
        <p>New Delhi is the capital of India</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dhaka">
        <h2>Dhaka</h2>
        <p>Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh</p>
    </div>
