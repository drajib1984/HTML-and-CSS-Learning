    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <p>
        HTML includes various tags for different types of lists. Here's an explanation.
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Unorderd List</strong> </dt>
            <dd>The "ul" element represents an unordered list. An unordered list is a list where the list items are listed in no 
            particular order. Therefore, each list item can be listed without numbers or other ordering mechanisms. An unordered 
            list will typically be displayed with round or square bullet points next to each item (as opposed to numbers or letters etc). 
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Ordered List</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                "ol" element represents an ordered list. An ordered list is a list where the items have been ordered intentionally. 
                The main point of an ordered list is that the list items need to be ordered in order to convey the intended meaning.
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Defination List</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                "dl" represents a definition list. In a definition list, each list item contains two or more entries; a term and at least one 
                description. The term is represented by the "dt" element and the description is represented by the "dd" element. 
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <h1>HTML attributes</h1>
    <p>
        Attributes are extra pieces of code that can be inserted inside an HTML tag. They allow you to define how an HTML element 
        should be presented or how it should behave.
    </p>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In the above example, the "ol" tag has had an attribute added to it. The attribute is called "start" and its value is 5. 
        This attribute allows us to specify what number to start the list at.Similarly, we can have attribute for a reverse ordered list
    </p>
    <ol reversed start="2">
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Banana</li>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Mango</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For reverse ordered list I used "ol reversed start=2"
    </p>

    <h1>HTML Links</h1>
    <p>
        The above link is an example of a hyperlink. A hyperlink is a link that allows the user to navigate to another resource 
        (such as a web page) or download it (such as in downloading a file). In this case, we link to Google.
        <br>
        A hyperlink is created by using the "a href" tag, which is used to specify the destination URL.
        <br>
        The "a href" tag has a start and end tag. Any text or element between the start and end tag becomes the "clickable" part. 
        You'll notice that most web browsers will display hyperlinked text in a different color and underlined. However, as with 
        any HTML element, you do have control over how the link is styled by using CSS.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>

    <h1>Image & alt attribute with image</h1>
    <p>
        In HTML, you add images to a web page by using the "img src" tag, which is used to specify the image location.The 
        "img src" tag does not have an end tag. Only the start tag is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image must be at the specified location, otherwise you will end up with a "broken image". This means that, if the image 
        doesn't already exist on the web, you'll need to upload it before it will work on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
        The image must have the alt attribute specified. This attribute is used to provide a description of the image. 
        This is important, as it is possible that not all users will be able to see the image.
        <br>
        Here are some examples of where the alt attribute can be beneficial:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>User has disabled images on their browser.</li>
        <li>User has a slow internet connection, and images sometimes don't load.</li>
        <li>User is using text to speech software or a voice web browser. This could be because the user has a vision impairement, 
            or it could simply be that the user has chosen to use this feature to give his/her eyes a rest. It could also be that 
            the user finds it easier to listen to long blocks of text than to read. In these cases, the software would read out any 
            alt text and the image will still make sense to the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            User is using a text-only browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            There's a problem with the image (or the HTML) resulting in a "broken image".
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src = "photos/flower.svg" alt="image of a flower">

    <h1>HTML Tables</h1>
    <p1>
        In HTML, you can create a table by using the "table" tag along with the "tr" and "td" tags:
        <br>
        Each "tr" element represents a table row. Each "td" element represents a data cell.
        <br>
        The "th" is used for table heading
        <br>
        The "table" element supports the "border" and the "sortable" attributes.Using the border attribute will typically result in 
        the browser rendering a basic border around the table and its cells.
        <br>
        Two other attributes you might find useful when working with tables are the "colspan" and "rowspan" attributes. These can be used 
        with the "th" and "td" elements. They allow you to specify how many columns or rows the cell can merge/span.
        "caption" is used to give the table name
    </p1>
    <table border="2">
        <caption>
            Country-Capital-Official Language
        </caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Country Name</th>
            <th>Capital</th>
            <th>Official Language</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>India</td>
            <td>New Delhi</td>
            <td>Hindi</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bangladesh</td>
            <td>Dhaka</td>
            <td>Bengali</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pakistan</td>
            <td>Islamabad</td>
            <td>Urdu</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">USA</td>
            <td>New York</td>
            <td>English</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>New York</td>
            <td>English</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">Merging 2 columns</td>
            <td>----</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sri Lanka</td>
            <td>Colombo</td>
            <td>Sinhala</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
